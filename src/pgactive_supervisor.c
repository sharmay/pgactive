	 *
	 * 1. Supervisor registers per-db worker while holding
	 * pgactiveWorkerCtl->lock in pgactive_supervisor_rescan_dbs().
	 *
	 * 2. Started per-db worker needs pgactiveWorkerCtl->lock to update
	 * database oid in its shared memory slot and thus adds itself to lock's
	 * wait queue. Unless per-db worker updates database oid, supervisor
	 * cannot consider it started in find_perdb_worker_slot().
	 *
	 * 3. Supervisor releases the lock, but a waiter other than per-db worker
	 * acquires the lock. Meanwhile, the supervisor adds itself to the lock's
	 * wait queue, thanks to SetLatch() in pgactive_perdb_xact_callback().
	 *
	 * 4. Supervisor acquires the lock again before the first per-db worker
	 * and fails to find the first per-db worker in find_perdb_worker_slot()
	 * as it hasn't yet got a chance to update database oid in the shared
	 * memory slot. This makes supervisor register another per-db worker for
	 * the same pgactive-enabled database causing multiple per-db workers (and
	 * so multiple apply workers - each per-db worker starts an apply worker)
	 * to coexist. These multiple per-db workers don't let nodes joining the
	 * pgactive group to come out from catchup state to ready state.
	 *
	 * We fix this race condition by making supervisor register per-db worker,
	 * wait until postmaster starts it, give it a chance to update database
	 * oid in its shared memory slot and continue to scan for other
	 * pgactive-enabled databases. An assert-enabled function
	 * check_for_multiple_perdb_workers() helps to validate the fix.
