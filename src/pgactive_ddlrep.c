/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * pgactive_capture_ddl: remodeled DDL replication for pgactive on PostgreSQL 9.6. this
 * approach eschews use of DDL deparse, instead capturing raw SQL at
 * ProcessUtility_hook and the associated search_path. It's called from the
 * command filter.
 *
 * There's an unavoidable flaw with this approach, which is that differences in
 * object existence on upstream and downstream can cause DDL to have silently
 * different results. For example, if s_p is
 *
 *   schema1, schema2
 *
 * and schema1 is nonexistent on the upstream node, we'll CREATE TABLE in schema2
 * on the upstream. But if schema1 exists on the downstream we'll CREATE TABLE
 * on schema1 there. Oops. Our row replication is always schema-qualified so
 * subsequent data replication fail fail due to a missing table.
 *
 * Similarly, an ALTER TABLE or DROP TABLE can go to the wrong place if the
 * table exists in an earlier schema on the downstream than in the upstream.
 *
 * In pgactive none of these situations should arise in the first place, since we
 * expect the schema to be consistent across nodes. If they do, it's a mess.
 * But deparse has proved to be less robust than originally expected too, and
 * it's hard to support in 9.6, so this will do.
 *
 * Users should be encouraged to
 *
 *   SET search_path = ''
 *
 * before running DDL then explicitly schema-qualify everything. pg_catalog
 * will still be implicitly searched so they don't have to qualify basic types
 * and operators.
 *
 * This function leaks all over the place; we rely on the statement context
 * to clean up.
