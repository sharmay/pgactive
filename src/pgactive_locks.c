 * Copyright (C) 2014-2015, PostgreSQL Global Development Group
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 *    A relatively simple distributed DDL locking implementation:
 *
 *    Locks are acquired on a database granularity and can only be held by a
 *    single node. That choice was made to reduce both, the complexity of the
 *    implementation, and to reduce the likelihood of inter node deadlocks.
 *
 *    Because DDL locks have to acquired inside transactions the inter-node
 *    communication can't be done via a queue table streamed out via logical
 *    decoding - other nodes would only see the result once the the
 *    transaction commits. We don't have autonomous tx's or suspendable tx's
 *    so we can't do a tx while another is in progress. Instead the 'messaging'
 *    feature is used which allows to inject transactional and nontransactional
 *    messages in the changestream. (We could instead make an IPC request to
 *    another worker to do the required transaction, but since we have
 *    non-transactional messaging it's simpler to use it).
 *
 *    There are really two levels of DDL lock - the global lock that only
 *    one node can hold, and individual local DDL locks on each node. If
 *    a node holds the global DDL lock then it owns the local DDL locks on each
 *    node.
 *
 *    A global 'ddl' lock may be upgraded to the stronger 'write' lock. This
 *    carries no deadlock hazard because the weakest lock mode is still an
 *    exclusive lock.
 *
 *    Note that DDL locking in 'write' mode flushes the queues of all edges in
 *    the node graph, not just those between the acquiring node and its peers.
 *    If node A requests the lock, then it must have fully replayed from B and
 *    C and vice versa. But B and C must also have fully replayed each others'
 *    outstanding replication queues. This ensures that no row changes that
 *    might conflict with the DDL can be in flight anywhere.
 *
 *
 *    DDL lock acquisition basically works like this:
 *
 *    1) A utility command notices that it needs the global ddl lock and the local
 *       node doesn't already hold it. If there already is a local ddl lock
 *       it'll ERROR out, as this indicates another node already holds or is
 *       trying to acquire the global DDL lock.
 *
 *       (We could wait, but would need to internally release, back off, and
 *       retry, and we'd likely land up getting cancelled anyway so it's not
 *       worth it.)
 *
 *    2) It sends out a 'acquire_lock' message to all other nodes and sets
 *    	 local state pgactive_LOCKSTATE_ACQUIRE_TALLYING_CONFIRMATIONS
 *
 *
 *    Now, on each other node:
 *
 *    3) When another node receives a 'acquire_lock' message it checks whether
 *       the local ddl lock is already held. If so it'll send a 'decline_lock'
 *       message back causing the lock acquiration to fail.
 *
 *    4) If a 'acquire_lock' message is received and the local DDL lock is not
 *       held it'll be acquired and an entry into the 'pgactive_global_locks' table
 *       will be made marking the lock to be in the 'catchup' phase. Set lock
 *       state pgactive_LOCKSTATE_PEER_BEGIN_CATCHUP.
 *
 *    For 'write' mode locks:
 *
 *    5a) All concurrent user transactions will be cancelled (after a grace
 *        period, for 'write' mode locks only).
 *        State pgactive_LOCKSTATE_PEER_CANCEL_XACTS.
 *
 *    5b) A 'request_replay_confirm' message will be sent to all other nodes
 *        containing a lsn that has to be replayed.
 *        State pgactive_LOCKSTATE_PEER_CATCHUP
 *
 *    5c) When a 'request_replay_confirm' message is received, a
 *        'replay_confirm' message will be sent back.
 *
 *    5d) Once all other nodes have replied with 'replay_confirm' the local DDL lock
 *        has been successfully acquired on the node reading the 'acquire_lock'
 *        message (from 3)).
 *
 *    or for 'ddl' mode locks:
 *
 *    5) The replay confirmation process is skipped.
 *
 *    then for both 'ddl' and 'write' mode locks:
 *
 *	  6) The local pgactive_global_locks entry will be updated to the 'acquired'
 *	     state and a 'confirm_lock' message will be sent out indicating that
 *	     the local ddl lock is fully acquired. Set lockstate
 *	     pgactive_LOCKSTATE_PEER_CONFIRMED.
 *
 *
 *    On the node requesting the global lock
 *    (state still pgactive_LOCKSTATE_ACQUIRE_TALLYING_CONFIRMATIONS):
 *
 *    9) Apply workers receive confirm_lock and decline_lock messages and tally
 *       them in the local DB's pgactiveLocksDBState in shared memory.
 *
 *    In the user backend that tried to get the lock:
 *
 *    10a) Once all nodes have replied with 'confirm_lock' messages the global
 *         ddl lock has been acquired. Set lock state
 *         pgactive_LOCKSTATE_ACQUIRE_ACQUIRED.  Wait for the xact to commit or
 *         abort.
 *
 *      or
 *
 *    10b) If any 'decline_lock' message is received, the global lock acquisition
 *        has failed. Abort the acquiring transaction.
 *
 *    11) Send a release_lock message. Set lock state pgactive_LOCKSTATE_NOLOCK
 *
 *
 *    on all peers:
 *
 *    12) When 'release_lock' is received, release local DDL lock and remove
 *        entry from global locks table. Ignore if not acquired. Set lock state
 *        pgactive_LOCKSTATE_NOLOCK.
 *
 *
 *    There's some additional complications to handle crash safety:
 *
 *    Everytime a node starts up (after crash or clean shutdown) it sends out a
 *    'startup' message causing all other nodes to release locks held by it
 *    before shutdown/crash. Then the pgactive_global_locks table is read. All
 *    existing local DDL locks held on behalf of other peers are acquired. If a
 *    lock still is in 'catchup' phase the local lock acquiration process is
 *    re-started at step 6)
 *
 *    Because only one decline is sufficient to stop a DDL lock acquisition,
 *    it's likely that two concurrent attempts to acquire the DDL lock from
 *    different nodes will both fail as each declines the other's request, or
 *    one or more of their peers acquire locks in different orders. Apps that
 *    do DDL from multiple nodes must be prepared to retry DDL.
 *
 *    DDL locks are transaction-level but do not respect subtransactions.
 *    They are not released if a subtransaction rolls back.
 *    (2ndQuadrant/pgactive-private#77).
